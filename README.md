A simple text adventure framework for adventuring while texting. Seriously, everyone's made one of these before.

You can enter the debug mode by typing "debug" at the map select screen. This will allow you to see what Lua functions are being called, and in what order.

This has support for Lua files using [KopiLua](https://github.com/gfoot/kopilua) and uses JSON files for rooms using [SimpleJSON](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON).
