text-adventure
==============

A simple text adventure framework for adventuring while texting. Seriously, everyone's made one of these before.

This has support for Lua files using [KopiLua](https://github.com/gfoot/kopilua) and uses JSON files for rooms using [SimpleJSON](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON).
